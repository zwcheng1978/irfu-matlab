%%C_4_POINCARE_INDEX - Calculates the poincare index using B-field measurements
%from four S/C's in a tetrahedron formation. 
%
%This function calculates the poincaré index from B-fields measurements. If index is a nonzero number
%than there is at least one null point within the volume.
%
%   index=poincare_index_3D(B1,B2,B3,B4)
%   index = [time index]
%   B? is the B-field measured at satellite ?
%
% Important: This method only works in the 3D case. That is when none of
% the eigenvalues in deltaB vanish. The time tags needs to be included in each vector or the program won't
% work
