# This is used for starting the MATLAB process of irfu-matlab code on SDC for the MMS mission.
# Author: T. Nilsson, IRFU
# Date: 2014/03/04
#
# Usage: place script in the same folder as has irfu-matlab as a subfolder, then run
#  "./script.sh <mmsX_dce_filename> <mmsX_dcv_filename> <mmsX_101_filename>", with the following
#  input arguments: (order is irrelevant as long as the OptionalDataDescriptor is "_dce_", "_dcv_", or "_101_").
#    <mmsX_***_dce_filename.cdf> = Filename of DC E data to be processed for 'xyz'. Including path and extension.
#    <mmsX_***_dcv_filename.cdf> = Filename of DC V data to be processed for 'xyz'. Including path and extention.
#    <mmsX_***_101_filename.cdf> = Filename of HK 101 data (with sunpulse) to be processed for 'xyz'. Including path and extention.
#  output files created:
#    <mmsX_***_xyz_yyyymmddHHMMSS_vX.Y.Z.cdf>         = File placed in $DROPBOX_ROOT
#    <DATE_IRFU.log>                                  = Logfile of run, placed in $LOG_PATH_ROOT/mmsX/sdp/.
#    <mmsX_***_xyz_yyyymmddHHMMSS_vX.Y.Z_runTime.log> = File to identify output file, as per e-mail of 2013/11/22. Also placed in $LOG_PATH_ROOT/mmsX/sdp/.
#
#  return code 0 if ok.
#  return code 199 if built in Matlab error.
#  return code 100-198 if MMS Matlab specific code error.
#
# Note: The script assumes it is located in the folder which has irfu-matlab as a subfolder.
